We call the computer you want to login is remote PC, the computer you currently use to log into the remote PC is host PC
Step 1: on remote PC, install x11vnc and openssh-server package
Step 2: on remote PC, If you reconfigure the firewall, need to make sure ssh can use on remote PC. In other words, port 22 should be accpeted by the firewall;
Step 3: on remote PC, Add you host PC's public key to your remote PC's ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
Step 4: on host PC, edit a shell script as below:
---
#!/bin/sh

ssh -C -f -L 5900:localhost:5900 rebecca@rebeccas-pc.dyndns.org \
        x11vnc -safer -localhost -nopw -once -display :0 \
        && sleep 5 \
        && vncviewer localhost:0

Everytime, when you want to remote desktop to your remote PC, just run the script. 
Note: the script actually log into your remote PC and set up the vncserver fist; and then run vncviewer on your host PC to connect to your remote PC. 
On Mac, vncviewer command does not exist. Need to change vncviewer command to Real VNC's VNC Viewer. (Run the software by using open command.)
