How to configure serial port for domU
(Discussion is from http://xen.1045712.n5.nabble.com/Serial-port-access-from-DomU-td2603705.html)
Background:- I have tested a Gentoo Virtual machine (DOMU) to access the serial port of Physical machine (opensuse 11.1) (DOM0) using the following configuration. 

Step1: Following modules should be loaded on the DOM0 
8250 
8250_pnp 
serial_core 

check is using "lsmod" command. 

Step 2:- Finding the IRQ and ioport ranges. 

Run the following command on the DOM0 to find the irq for the serial port. 

# dmesg |grep tty 
serial8250: ttyS0 at I/O 0x3f8 (irq = 4) is a 16550A 
serial8250: ttyS1 at I/O 0x2f8 (irq = 3) is a 16550A 

and run the following command to find the ioport 


# cat /proc/ioports |grep serial 
02f8-02ff : serial 
03f8-03ff : serial 

now add the following lines in the DOMU config file ( i mean configuration file of virtual machine) 


domU config: 
irq = [ 4 ] 
ioports = [ "02f8-02ff" ] 

check with minicom
